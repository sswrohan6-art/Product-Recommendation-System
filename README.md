## 📂 Project Structure

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes multiple ML classifiers to predict sentiment from product reviews.
- **Recommendation System**: Built using **user-based** and **item-based filtering** methods.
- **Sentiment Integration**: Combines sentiment scores with collaborative filtering for improved recommendations.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Used the **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** for text cleaning and preparation.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracted features using **TF-IDF** and **Word2Vec** from a dataset containing over **30,000 product reviews**.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Applied several classifiers for sentiment analysis:
  - Logistic Regression (LR)
  - Random Forest (RF)
  - XGBoost (XGB)
  - AdaBoost (AB)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** emerged as the top performer, optimized with **5-fold cross-validation**.
- **Recommender System**:
  - Utilized **cosine similarity** for both user-user and item-item collaborative filtering.
  - Finalized **User-User collaborative filtering** with an **RMSE of 1.6**.
  - Integrated sentiment scores into the recommendation engine for better accuracy.

## 💻 Key Technologies

- **Python**: Core language for development.
- **NLTK**: For text preprocessing, including tokenization and stemming.
- **TF-IDF & Word2Vec**: Employed for feature extraction from text data.
- **scikit-learn, XGBoost**: Libraries used to train classifiers.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Distance metric used in collaborative filtering.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Both user-based and item-based filtering approaches.

## 📈 Model Performance

- **Sentiment Analysis**: SVM showed superior performance over other classifiers.
- **Recommendation System**: The user-user based collaborative filtering model, enhanced with sentiment analysis, led to substantial improvement in recommendation accuracy.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naman12072000/Product-recommendation-using-sentiment-analysis/edit/main/README.md
   cd product-recommendation-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the sentiment analysis and recommendation scripts**:
   ```bash
   python sentiment_analysis.py
   python recommendation_system.py
   ```

4. **Customize with your own data**:
   - Replace `data.csv` with your own dataset of product reviews for customized recommendations.
